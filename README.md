## loyalty_analysis_dataset

Build the loyalty analysis dataset that powers the Loyalty Analysis dashboard
Follow the Jupyter Notebook in order to build a loyalty dataset from scratch.  
The schemas required for two key databases are attached:  

* Final loyalty analysis dataset used in the data studio report  
* Schema for raw data imported from parse.ly  

**NOTE The example in the Jupyter Notebook creates the loyalty data for two months, Jan-2019 and Feb-2019. If you want to create the dataset for a single month then the steps will be slightly altered.**
